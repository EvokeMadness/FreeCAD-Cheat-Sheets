Hi!

My name is Allie and I am a CAD hobbyist. Computer aided design is my passion and I am enthusiastic about sharing my knowledge. My CAD package of choice is Alibre Design and Salome. However, I am experienced in several CAD packages and recommend FreeCAD to beginners due to the great amount of information available to users beginning to explore CAD. This project started as a graphic I made in Inkscape to help a friend understand constraints in the Sketcher Workbench and was remade in drawio as a resource for beginner users of FreeCAD.

### Style Guide
+ Documents are made using [drawio](https://www.diagrams.net/) on US-Letter (8,5" x 11") canvas size, in portrait orientation, and have a 0.5" border.
+ Descriptions are concise, design and practice agnostic, and use terms pertaining to the CAD software used.
+ Examples are made in [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) and the behavior of the figures are demonstrated chronologically from left to right using arrows where necessary.
+ Graphics such as icons are sourced directly from the CAD software's source code, wiki, or a high quality screenshot.
