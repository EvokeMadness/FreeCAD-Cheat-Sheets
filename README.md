# Abstract
Workbench cheat sheets are a resource for beginner and experienced FreeCAD users. The cheat sheets are concise and are limited in length to ensure easy printability and convenient use. The cheat sheets are provided in PDF form and the files were created using [drawio](https://www.diagrams.net/) and post-processed using [PDFtk Server](https://www.pdflabs.com/docs/pdftk-man-page/) on Windows. The examples were created using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/). Cheat sheets are an easy resource to leave at your desk and reference in the moment without leaving your program, speeding up your workflow. The FreeCAD Cheat sheet project is freely available and is licensed under the MIT license. This project is also a collaborative open source project on GitHub.
