# Part Design Workbench

- Is a solid modeler
	+ Generally used in mechanical design
- Solids are made using sketches
	+ Sketches are two dimensional and planar
		* Sketches must be a closed figure to construct solid geometry
- First operation is additive
- Following operations are attached to existing geometry
- Operations and features are applied and listed consecutively

# Four Basic Constructive Operations of solid modeling

1. Extrude
2. Revolve
3. Sweep
4. Loft

- Operations may be additive or subtractive
	+ Subtractive operations are applied to existing solids
- Sketches may be attached to an existing face
	+ This face must be *planar*
- Sketches may reference preexisting edges outside of the sketch

# Basic Features

- Fillet and Chamfer
	+ Applied to an edge
- Pattern or Array

# Datums or References

- Basic geometry
	+ Point or vertex
		* 'Vertex' or verticies are points where two or more lines meet
	+ Line
	+ Face
	+ LCS or local coordinate system. Similar to Ordinate dimensioning
